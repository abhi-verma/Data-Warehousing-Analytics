## Data-Warehousing-Analytics

Dominick’s Finer Foods is a major grocery chain that is exclusive to the Chicagoland area. As part of the project, I created data warehouse will provide Dominick’s with a critical decision support system.  The decisions made through using this new data warehouse will provide Dominick’s a competitive advantage over its major rivals including Kroger and Jewel-Osco.
This report documents the tasks completed to create a conformed data warehouse schema for Dominick’s Finer Foods, according to Ralph Kimball’s dimensional modeling methodology.  In addition, this report further documents our ETL Design and implementation processes in depth.
I have used HOLAP style for the data warehouse, Microsoft® SQL Server® 2012, and SSIS for the ETL implementation. The analytics and reporting was implemented using Report Builder, SSRS and SSAS.
